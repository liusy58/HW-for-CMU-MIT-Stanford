###### 77.Let [A b] be the augmented matrix of a system of linear equations. Prove thant if its reduced row echelon form is [R c], then R is thc reduced row echelon form of A.

---
If [R c] is in reduced row echelon form, then so is R. If we apply the same row operations to A that were applied to [A b] to produce [R c], we obtain the matrix R. So R is the reduced row echelon form of A.
