### Lec1

###### Two Great Ideas
* Probability from Examples
* Artificial Neurons

###### Machine Learning
Basically just a rebranding of statistics and probability.

### Lec2 Combinatorics

###### Permutations
A permutation is an ordered arrangement of distinct object. n objects can be permuted in:
$n \times(n-1) \times(n-2) \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1=n !$

###### Sample Space
Sample space, S, is set of all possible outcomes of an experiment

###### Events
Event, E, is some subset of S.

### Lec3
General definition of Chain Rule:
$$
\begin{array}{l}P\left(E_{1} E_{2} E_{3} \ldots E_{n}\right) \\ \quad=P\left(E_{1}\right) P\left(E_{2} | E_{1}\right) P\left(E_{3} | E_{1} E_{2}\right) \ldots P\left(E_{n} | E_{1} E_{2} \ldots E_{n-1}\right)\end{array}
$$
